\usage{

\item{df}{A dataframe (You can also pass this program a single variable and it will silently transform it to a dataframe)}

\item{var}{a variable in associated dataframe}

\item{plot}{if TRUE (default) prints bar chart of results.  If FALSE, no chart.}

\item{sort}{If TRUE (default), sort output in descending order of n. If FALSE, sort output in ascending order of levels}

\item{na.rm}{if FALSE (default) NAs are included in frequency list.  If TRUE, NA are removed (but reported seperately)}
}
\value{
dataframe containing frequencies.
}
\description{
\code{freq} prints a frequency table for the variable passed to it.
}

This function prints a frequency table for the variable passed to it.  In
order to fit within the tidyverse, it takes as its first argument a dataframe
and returns the frequency table as a dataframe.
